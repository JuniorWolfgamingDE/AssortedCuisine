# Assorted Cuisine
An assortment of food and health related items.
<br>While supposed to be used with other Assorted mods, Assorted Cuisine also works on it's own.

### What does Assorted Cuisine add?
Currently adds the following:
- Soda: 10 different soda flavors which restore health.
- Dragon Fruit: Cacti will now be able to drop Dragon Fruit when broken at age.
- Sweets: 2 different variants of sweets which replenish your hunger on-the-go.
- Health Packs: Useful health packs which can heal you quickly in combat.
- Food: Butter, Cheese, Sandwiches, Scrambled eggs - all you need for a balanced breakfast.
- Pies: Melon pie, Chocolate pie - too many pies!

Coming soon / WIP:
- Chocolate: Chocolate blocks, cake, bars...

### Didn't this exist before?
Yes! As Grim Cuisine, a part of Grim Pack. But since the release of the remake AssortedMods, Cuisine has been missing. That's why I remade it! And Grim3212 is fine with it (I guess, he has recognized my work) :)
